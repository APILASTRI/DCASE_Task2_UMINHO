# DCASE_Task2_UMINHO

Anomalous sound detection (ASD) is the task of identifying whether the sound emitted from a target machine is normal or anomalous. The automatic detection of mechanical failures can bring numerous benefits for industry 4.0 and for factory automation using artificial intelligence (AI)[1]. 
The challenge (dcase 2020 task 2) is to detect unknown anomalies sounds under the condition that only normal sound samples have were provided as training data. For this task, a baseline system implementation was provided for comparison purposes [1].
